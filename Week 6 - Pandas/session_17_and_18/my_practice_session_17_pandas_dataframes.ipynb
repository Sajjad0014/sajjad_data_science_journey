Don (Bhagwan Das Mishra). Shravan falls for Mishra's niece (Sunaina). The Don does not approve of this match because of previous scuffle between Bhagwan and Shravan. Shravan strives to win Sunaina's hand in marriage and becomes a successful boxer while trying to avoid retaliation from the Don.   \n",

nuclear state are at first met with criticism and then years later  with an offer from the government. With the help of Himanshu Shukla  the Prime Minister's principal secretary  he leads a team to conduct a second nuclear test series. The only major threat lurking is the American Lacrosse satellite which caught the first test preparations  further causing America to warn India about such future tests. With their patriotic hearts and unbreakable spirits  Ashwat and his team race against time to conduct the tests confidentially while the country's worsening political scenario as well as the presence of spies from US and Pakistan puts them into both mental as well as physical challenges.   \n",

not like his disrespectful rule-breaking unconventional ways. In Chennai  he chances upon the raw fighting talent of Madhi  the sibling of aspiring boxer Lakshmi. He decides to put all his effort to tame Madhie and get her to shine but he is repeatedly put off by her playfulness & distrust.   \n",

                                                               Karan is a lazy good-for-nothing who lives on the generated income of his father and elder brother at their family business. Karan's days: hang out with buddies and romance a woman named Romi. When he watches an action movie  he decides to enlist in the army with a friend  but basic training proves to be too much of a bother and he shortly abandons it  thus making him lose respect on the home front. Romi also stops respecting him. Karan decides he must re-join the army and show his family and Romi that he  too  is focused upon the path he has to take in this lifetime  but will he be resilient enough to carry out this task?   \n",

                             An SP Amit Kumar who is given charge of Tezpur police station in Bihar. The area is full of corruption  inefficiency  bribery  nepotism  favoritism and crime with help from the local police. Gradually Amit realizes that the local politician Sadhu Yadav is the one who benefits the most out of it. Amit arrests Sunder Yadav  Sadhu's son. While Sunder is released soon  some police officers  get frustrated with the system  and pour acid into the eyes of two of Yadav's men  blinding them. A hue and cry is raised by the media  crime almost comes to a standstill  and the police are regarded with respect. SP Amit Kumar must now put an end to this kind of situation.   \n",
