The Only SQL You Actually Need For Your First Job
(From someone who interviews data analysts)

The Learning Trap:
* Complex subqueries
* Advanced CTEs
* Recursive queries
* 100+ tutorials watched
* 0 practical experience


75% of my daily SQL tasks as a junior data analyst:
* Basic SELECT, FROM, WHERE
* JOINs
* GROUP BY
* ORDER BY
* Simple aggregations
* ROW_NUMBER

The Secret:
It's not about knowing everything
It's about doing simple things well

What You ACTUALLY Need:

1. SELECT Mastery
* SELECT * LIMIT 10
 (yes, for exploration only!)
* COUNT, SUM, AVG
 (used every single day)
* DATE functions
 (life-saving for reports)
* CASE WHEN 

2. JOIN Logic
* LEFT JOIN
 (your best friend)
* INNER JOIN
 (your second best friend)
* That's it.
 (seriously)

3. WHERE Magic
* Basic conditions
* AND, OR operators
* IN, NOT IN
* NULL handling
* LIKE for text search

4. GROUP BY Essentials
* Basic grouping
* HAVING clause
* Multiple columns
* Simple aggregations

Most common tasks:
* Pull monthly sales
* Count unique customers
* Calculate basic metrics
* Filter date ranges
* Join 2-3 tables

Focus on:
* Clean code
* Clear comments
* Consistent formatting
* Proper indentation

Want to stand out?

Learn to:
* Document your queries
* Handle NULL values properly
* Format dates consistently
* Write readable code
* Use clear column names

P.S. Complex SQL will come naturally when you ACTUALLY need it
P.P.S. But you'll need basic SQL every day
P.P.P.S. Start there!
